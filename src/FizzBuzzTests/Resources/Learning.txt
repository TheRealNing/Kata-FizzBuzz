According to http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/stringbuilder.html, concatenating two constant strings is extremely efficient
because the compiler knows that both constants will always make the same string, so it makes that string for you as another constant,
i.e. you're code doesn't actually concatenate the strings at all!
